<h2>SQL Project 6</h2>
Identify all customers in our market who registered in person at a physical branch location and extract the fields necessary to evaluate member engagement through face-to-face channels. We need this for individuals who have at least a 700 credit score, didn’t require a co-signer, and have had their account for at least 7 years OR customers who are younger than 65 years old who have had their account for at least 10 years. Your output should include:
Member ID
First and Last Name
Method of Sign-Up (branch enrollment)
Credit score
Email address (if they have one on record)
Consider how analyzing in-person registration volume can provide insight into branch effectiveness, staffing needs, and the balance between digital and traditional onboarding strategies.
